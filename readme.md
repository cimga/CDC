The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is a compilation of responses from telephone interviews done with participants from across the United States and its territories. The BRFSS data can be used to benchmark health status across populations. For this assessment, you have been tasked with comparing Rhode Island to other New England states based on data from the 2017 BRFSS, available here:â€‹https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2017.html

You will find three outlines as below:

Outlined my approach to download, process, and analyze the 2017 BRFSS data using a formal modeling language (here I used UML),
Identified features that distinguish Rhode Island from at least three other New England states
Evaluated four classifiers to predict what state associated with a set of responses
